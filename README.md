OBJECTIVE

Can you develop a model of machine learning that can predict the salaries of software developers?

The goal is to estimate a Software Developer's salary.

DETAILS ABOUT DATASET
This dataset was originally taken from the www.kaggle.com which is maintained at StackOverFlow.com. The salary data is originally named as StackOverFlow2018. This dataset is based on a worldwide software developer survey conducted by the above mentioned website.

RESULTS

Non-Linear Regression:
The best model is Light GBM Regressor between CART,ANN,RF,MLP,XGBOOST.Based on the operations performed, Light GBM Regression gave the lowest error. Light GBM: 35.000.
